# Optimisation Of Transaction Monitoring Process in AML Using A Statistical Approach

## Description 
### **Problem:** 
Due to increasingly strict Anti Money Laundering regulations banks, among others, are:
1) Receiving sometimes billions of euros in fines for not complying properly
2) Hiring teams of people to manually investigate the alerts generated by current AML systems

### **Our Goal:**
Develop new system using sound statistical methodology that:
1) Complies with current regualtions
2) Automatically reduces the number of false positives generated and hence investigator workload

## Data:
For privacy reasons we cannot release data set!

## **Overview of plan:**
![2 Stage Process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30290960/30808840-f2261de4-a1ff-11e7-8dd6-3b748376f57a.PNG)

1) Stage 1 - We receive data set of alerted transactions with labels of SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) or No SAR. 
Our goal here is to:
  - Create predictive model to predict No SAR and find the optimal cut off value to autclose non suspicious alerts
  - Explain importance of the variables (Very important as bank employee must be able to explain to investigator why the AML system has autoclosed an alert)

2) Stage 2 - We take a look at the rules used to generate the original alerts and tune them for each customer profile. This will reduce the original number of alerts generated next time around!

### *Stage 1*
Overview of methodology:

1) Initial Data Cleaning
2) Top down segmentation
3) Feature selection, replacing missing values
4) Standardization and exploratory analysis
5) Bottom up clustering
6) Model Building
7) Model Evaluation and Autoclosing of alerts

### *Stage 2*
