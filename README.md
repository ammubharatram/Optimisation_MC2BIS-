# Optimisation Of Transaction Monitoring Process in AML Using A Statistical Approach

## Description 
### **Problem:** 
Due to increasingly strict Anti Money Laundering regulations banks, among others, are:
1) Receiving sometimes billions of euros in fines for not complying properly
2) Hiring teams of people to manually investigate the alerts generated by current AML systems

### **Our Goal:**
Develop new system using sound statistical methodology that:
1) Complies with current regualtions
2) Automatically reduces the number of false positives generated and hence investigator workload

A 2-Stage Process
