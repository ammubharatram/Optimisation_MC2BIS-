# Optimisation Of Transaction Monitoring Process Using A Statistical Approach

## **Problem:** With increasingly strict Regualtions on Anti-Money-Laundering that banks must comply with comes a serious need for a comprehensive methodology to detect the money launderers while also generating as few false positives as possible. This is a big task as it's like finding a needle in a haystack full of transaction data!

This is an interesting issue as in recent years banks have been getting billions in fines for not having adequate systems in place. Also, current systems used generate far to many false positives and banks employ hundreds of people to investigate generated alerts manually to comply with regulations. 

Our goal is to develop a system to optimise the number of alerts generated so that:
a) Banks meet regulation requirements 
b) The systems don't generate so many false positives

...To be continued tomorrow...
